**Abstract**

The deep stereo models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on driving scenes, but they suffer from severe performance degradation when tested on unseen scenes. Although recent work has narrowed this performance gap through continuous online adaptation, this setup requires
continuous gradient updates at inference and can hardly deal with rapidly changing scenes. To address these challenges, we propose to perform continual stereo matching where a model is tasked to 1) continually learn new scenes, 2) overcome forgetting previously learned scenes, and 3)
continuously predict disparities at deployment. We achieve this goal by introducing a Reusable Architecture Growth (RAG) framework. RAG leverages task-specific neural unit search and architecture growth for continual learning of new scenes. During growth, it can maintain high reusability by reusing previous neural units while achieving good performance. A module named Scene Router is further introduced to adaptively select the scene-specific architecture path at inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves compelling performance in various types of challenging driving scenes.

## Supervised Continual Stereo

### Code Structure

 - ./src/approaches: the reusable architecture growth framework
 - ./src/automl: neural units search and network level growth
 - ./src/dataloader: datasets preprocess and dataloader
 - ./src/filenames: dataset lists, e.g., four scenes with different weather
 - ./src/models: stereo models with Feature Net and Matching Net
 - ./src/utilstool: tool code for metrics
 - ./logs/: running logs
 
### Command to start experiment
```
sh run_rag.sh
```

## Self-supervised Continual Stereo
### Code structure
The code structure of *self-supervised continual stereo* is similar to that of *supervised continual stereo*, and all the code is in the `src_self` folder. The main additions are in the `src_self/dataloader` folder.

### Command to start experiment
```
sh run_rag_self.sh
```

## Extension to monocular depth estimation
### Code structure
The code structure of *supervised continual monocular depth estimation* is similar to that of *supervised continual stereo*, and all the code is in the `rag_depth` folder. 
### Command to start experiment
```
cd rag_depth
sh run_rag_depth.sh
```
### Pretrained weights
The pretrained weights trained on the DrivingStereo dataset are in the `rag_depth/logs` folder. The code we have shared currently encompasses the training and inference evaluation together. We welcome any insights and ideas to translate the training code into a functional inference system in order to leverage the pretrained weights.
